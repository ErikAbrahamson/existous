      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <section id="slide1">
        <p>I was born and raised in the Hudson Valley of New York. Growing up I spent most of my time either outdoors or behind a computer screen. Living in such a great area gave me the chance to develop a deep and meaningful relationship with nature and its inhabitants.
        </p>
        <p>After it was time to leave the nest, I went on to study Philosophy at Ithaca College. Doing so strengthened my relationship with nature and our world, albeit turning me against technology and modern technology.
        </p>
        <p>After graduating I found myself working at a private clinical psychology practice, assisting with group therapy for young adults with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Although I found this field compelling, I was itching to try something new and unknown.
        </p>
        <p>Just over one year ago, I moved to Denver in hopes of finding more meaningful pursuits in a new environment. Because I had some background knowledge in web development, I began working at a digital media firm. Shortly after beginning to work there, I found myself intrigued by the 'behind-the-scenes' development.
        </p>
        <p>Doing a complete shift in belief in technology, I pursued web development, and shortly learn about <strong>gSchool</strong>.
